# Football Players Prediction

## About The Project

This project focuses on developing a football players prediciton model based on various parameters. Leveraging TensorFlow, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, a module where on the bases of the skills, gameply, performance it predics the players.

## Tools and Technologies:

* TensorFlow: Utilized for building and training deep learning models for toxicity detection, specifically employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
* Pandas: Employed for data manipulation and analysis.
* Scikit-learn: Used for machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.

### Key Features:
* Preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned and prepared for modeling.
* Evaluation: The accuracy achieved was 0.480.
